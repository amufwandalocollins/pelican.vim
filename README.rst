UNSTABLE. DO NOT USE!

pelican.vim
=============

This script is intended to automate the process of creating and editing
`Pelican <http://getpelican.com>`_ blog posts from within `vim <http://www.vim.org>`_.

This is a complete rewrite of
`csexton/jekyll.vim <https://github.com/csexton/jekyll.vim`_ for the Pelican crowd.
