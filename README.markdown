# pelican.vim

Blogging from the command line should not be tedious.

This script is intended to automate the process of creating and editing
[Pelican](http://getpelican.com/) blog posts from within
[vim](http://www.vim.org/).

This is a complete rewrite of
[csexton/jekyll.vim](https://github.com/csexton/jekyll.vim/) for the Pelican crowd.

## Commands

Soon...

## License

Same as Vim itself, see `:help license`.
